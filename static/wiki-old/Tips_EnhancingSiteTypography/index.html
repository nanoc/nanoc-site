<h1>Enhancing the typography on your site</h1>

!RubyPants (a Ruby port of !SmartyPants) can be used to improve the typography of a HTML page by replacing "--" with proper em dashes, replacing "..." with proper ellipsises, converting straight quotation marks into proper curly quotation marks, and more.

To use this filter with nanoc, add <code>filter :rubypants</code> to the compilation block in the Rules file, like this:

<pre><code>
compile '/some/item/' do
  filter :rubypants
end
</code></pre>

Note that some filters provide this functionality out of the box. At least <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>(<a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/">RedCloth</a>) is known to do so. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>(<a href="http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/tree/master">RDiscount</a>) does not. (Here is a <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/manual/#filters">List of Built-in Filters</a>.)</pre>
