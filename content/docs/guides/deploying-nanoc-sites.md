Deploying
---------

There are quite a few ways to deploy a site to a web host. The most traditional way of uploading a site involves using FTP to transfer the files (perhaps using an “update” or “synchronise” option). If your web host provides access via SSH, you can use SCP or SFTP to deploy a site.

With rsync
----------

If your web host supports rsync, then deploying a site can be fully automated, and the transfer itself can be quite fast, too. rsync is unfortunately a bit cumbersome, providing a great deal of options (check <kbd>man rsync</kbd> in case of doubt), but fortunately nanoc provides a “deploy” command that can make this quite a bit easier: a simple <kbd>nanoc deploy</kbd> will deploy your site.

To use the deploy command, open the `nanoc.yaml` (on older sites: `config.yaml`) file and add a `deploy` hash. Inside, add a hash with a key that describes the destination (for example, `public` or `staging`). Inside this hash, set `dst` to the destination, in the format used by rsync and scp, to where the files should be uploaded, and set `kind` to `rsync`. Here’s what it will look like:

	#!yaml
	deploy:
	  public:
	    kind: rsync
	    dst:  "stoneship.org:/var/www/sites/example.com/public"
	  staging:
	    kind: rsync
	    dst:  "stoneship.org:/var/www/sites/example.com/public/staging"

By default, the rsync deployer will upload all files in the output directory to the given location. None of the existing files in the target location will be deleted; however, be aware that files with the same name will be overwritten. To run the deploy command, pass it a `--target` option, like this:

<pre title="Deploying"><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>nanoc deploy --target staging</kbd></pre>

This will deploy using the “staging” configuration. Replace “staging” with “public” if you want to deploy to the location marked with “public”.

If you want to check whether the executed `rsync` command is really correct, you can perform a dry run by passing `--dry-run`. The rsync command will be printed, but not executed. For example:

<pre title="Performing a dry run"><span class="prompt">%</span> <kbd>nanoc deploy --target public --dry-run</kbd></pre>

### Deleting stray files

nanoc will, by default, only update files that have changes, and not remove any files from the remote destination. If you _do_ want to let <kbd>nanoc deploy</kbd> remove any files on the destination that are not part of the nanoc site, you can modify the options used for rsync to include `--delete-after`, like this:

<pre title="Custom rsync options in the deployment configuration"><code class="language-yaml">options: [ '-aP', '--delete-after' ]</code></pre>

<div class="admonition caution">This will remove all files and directories that do not correspond to nanoc items in the destination. Make sure that the destination does not contain anything that you still need.</div>

With github pages
-----------------

### Setup

The Github pages deploy process is nicely [described in Github's help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually). To set it up you need to create a orphaned branch dedicated to github pages:

    rm -rf output
    git branch --orphan gh-pages

Then clone the current repo into the output directory and `checkout` the new branch:

    git clone . output
    cd output
    git checkout gh-pages

Nuke the current content:

    rm -rf *
    git add .
    git commit -am "nukes the output directory and gh-pages branch"

Change the remote for this repo.

    git remote rm origin
    git remote add origin repo-url 

Add the `output` folder to your `.gitignore`. (Adding it to the repo does not help.) Every new user need to set up this branch manually.

Now you have an orphaned branch dedicated to github pages publishing. This branch now dwells in the output folder of your nanoc repo.

### Publish

To publish your nanoc site you start with running nanoc as normal:

    nanoc

Jump into output, commit the result and push the publishing branch.

    cd output
    git add .
    git commit -am "awesome content created"
    git push origin gh-pages

Wait a couple of minutes and your content will appear at http://yourgittusername.github.com/yourreponame . The above 5 lines can be put into a shell script for easy one-button publishing. I call mine `publish.sh`.

In this way both nanoc is happy - cause the output folder is where it is supposed to be - and github pages is happy - cause there is a nice and tidy branch called gh-pages with static publishable content. A weird side effect is that the gh-pages in the output directory is likely to be out of sync with the gh-pages branch in your base repo. You can either remove the branch from the base repo or just make sure to `pull` after a succesful publish.
