<h1>Easily Accessing Compiled Content</h1>

In nanoc 3.0.x, to access the compiled content of an item, you have to first get hold of the right item and then fetch the content at a specific snapshot. This is cumbersome, so nanoc 3.1.0 will introduce a cleaner way to fetch compiled content from an item. It’ll work like this:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
item.compiled_content
item.compiled_content(:rep => :raw)
item.compiled_content(:snapshot => :pre)
item.compiled_content(:rep => :raw, :snapshot => :pre)
</code></pre>

You can already use this new <code>#compiled_content</code> method in 3.0.x. Put the following code somewhere in your lib/ directory (e.g. lib/compiled_content.rb):

<pre><code>
#!ruby
class Nanoc3::Item

  # Returns the compiled content from a given representation and a given
  # snapshot. This is a convenience method that makes fetching compiled
  # content easier.
  #
  # @option params [String] :rep (:default) The name of the representation
  #   from which the compiled content should be fetched. By default, the
  #   compiled content will be fetched from the default representation.
  #
  # @option params [String] :snapshot (:last) The name of the snapshot from
  #   which to fetch the compiled content. By default, the fully compiled
  #   content will be fetched, with all filters and layouts applied--not the
  #   pre-layout content.
  def compiled_content(params={})
    rep_name      = params[:rep]      || :default
    snapshot_name = params[:snapshot] || :last

    # Get rep
    rep = reps.find { |r| r.name == rep_name }
    if rep.nil?
      raise Nanoc3::Errors::Generic,
        "No rep named #{rep_name.inspect} was found."
    end

    # Get rep's content
    rep.content_at_snapshot(snapshot_name)
  end

end

</code></pre>
