<h1>Copying assets intelligently</h1>

You can let nanoc to copy assets into the output/ directory before compilation in a few ways:

<h2>Using rsync</h2>

rsync is useful because it makes sure assets are only copied when they’re not copied already, for instance. It can also prevent subversion directories from being copied. To use rsync, create a Rake task which does something along these lines:

<pre><code>
task :copy_assets do
  sh "rsync -gprt --partial --exclude='.svn' assets/ output"
end

task :compile do
  sh "nanoc3 co"
end

task :build => [ :compile, :copy_assets ]
</code></pre>

You may want to play with the options, but the default set of options (the one used above) is probably good enough.

If you want, you can make the compile task from above be the default task, so you can simply type rake, which is even shorter than nanoc co (or nanoc compile), like this:

<pre><code>
task :default => :build
</code></pre>

<h2>Using Ruby</h2>

Another way to do it is the following quick 'n dirty hack in Ruby code:

<pre><code>
%w{yaml}.each{|lib| require lib}
# a rake task to copy any css and javascript
# files over to the webroot output directory

config  = YAML.load(File.open("config.yaml"))

def path_tree(path,to_copy=[])
  tree = []
  Dir.glob("#{path}/*").each do |path|
    if File.directory?(path)
      tree << path_tree(path)
    else
      tree << path
      path_tree(path)
    end
  end
  tree.flatten
end

task :default do
  config["asset_dirs"].each do |search_dir|
    path_tree(search_dir).each do |asset|
      # Some vars
      from  = asset
      to    = [config["output_dir"],asset].join("/")
      # Create dir for file, if necessary;
      # e.g., for /path/to/file.txt
      # create /path/to, if need be
      if !File.exist?(File.dirname(to))
        puts "mkdir -p #{File.dirname(to)}"
        File.makedirs(File.dirname(to))
      end
      # Copy the file over, but only if it's changed or doesn't already exist
      if !File.exist?(to) || !File.compare(from,to)
        puts "cp #{from} #{to}"
        File.copy(from,to)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

Put something like this in your config.yaml:

<pre><code>
asset_dirs: ["css", "js"]
</code></pre>

Where each member of the array is a subdir of the nanoc root directory that you want copied over.</pre>
