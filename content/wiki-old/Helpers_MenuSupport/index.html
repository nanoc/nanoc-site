<h2>About</h2>

As a helper for automatic menu generation won't be universally usable it is not planned to include one in nanoc's core. (<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/nanoc/msg/58c0b74db9f3b044">See here</a>)[[BR]]
But there are some mails on nanoc's mailing list regarding this topic. This wiki page was created to collect useful information about how to generate menus with nanoc's help.

<h2>discussion on the mailing list</h2>

<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/nanoc/browse_thread/thread/da2ad380afefcf13">automatic menu generation (2008-12)</a> [[BR]]
<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/group/nanoc/browse_thread/thread/da6397b3b771a2a5">Integration of menu support (2009-03)</a>

<h2>example</h2>

The two links above show code to do this with old versions of nanoc. The code shown below is an adapted version of the code in the top link above.
See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc/browse_thread/thread/a4b843ef917891bd">here</a> for the post on the group from Denis about this.

<pre><code>
&lt;% home_page = @items.find { |i| i.reps[0].path == '/' } %>
<ul>
    <li>&lt;%= link_to(home_page[:title], home_page.reps[0]) %></li>
    &lt;% home_page.children.each do |page| %>
        <li>&lt;%= link_to(page[:title], page.reps[0]) %></li>
    &lt;% end %>
</ul>
</code></pre>

<h2>comments</h2>

I think it would be helpful to post a well commented example here. May be I (or someone else) will do that later.</pre>
