<h1>Wishlist</h1>

This page is meant to collect ideas for future versions of nanoc. Depending on whether it can be incorporated into the next minor or next major version, these will be moved to <a href="../Development_4.0/">Development/4.0</a> or <a href="../Development_3.1/">Development/3.1</a>. Feel free to add your own ideas to this page.

<h2>Easy way to render one item inside another</h2>

That is, items as partials. The following seems unwieldy (although of course it can be wrapped in a helper)

<pre><code>
#!ruby
someitem.reps.find { |rep| rep.name == :default }.content_at_snapshot(:last)
</code></pre>

Maybe have Item should have <code>#to_s</code>: <code>def to_s(rep = :default)</code>. User still need a suitable compile rule to ensure no layout is applied, and need to set <code>is_hidden</code> property.

Finding a child by name is also awkward:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
child = @item.children.find { |c| c.identifier == @item.identifier + name + '/' }
</code></pre>

Perhaps want Item#child method. If we have identifiers as paths, then we might also want to find sibling, e.g. /foo/about.html -> /foo/bar.css

-----

This will be partially resolved in nanoc 3.1. Getting the content of an item rep will be easier. Compare the old and the new ways:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
# old
someitem.reps.find { |rep| rep.name == :default }.content_at_snapshot(:pre)
someitem.reps.find { |rep| rep.name == :default }.content_at_snapshot(:last)
someitem.reps.find { |rep| rep.name == :moo }.content_at_snapshot(:pre)

# new
someitem.compiled_content
someitem.compiled_content(:snapshot => :last)
someitem.compiled_content(:rep => :moo)
</code></pre>

Finding a child by name could indeed be a bit cleaner. Perhaps a <code>Nanoc3::Identifier</code> class could be useful here. Such a class would make the code look more natural, e.g.:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
child = @item.children.find { |c| c.identifier.components[-1] == name }
</code></pre>

<h2><code>create_code_snippet</code> DataSource method</h2>

This method could be implemented by DataSources, and it would create a new code snippet. The signature would be <code>create_code_snippet(content, filename)</code> - for example,

<pre><code>
#!ruby
data_source.create_code_snippet(
  "\# All files in the lib/ directory will automatically " +
  "\# be loaded by nanoc when compiling the site.",
  'default.rb'
)
</code></pre>

In 3.0.x, all data sources (at least the built-in ones) load code from <code>.rb</code> files in the <code>lib/</code> directory. In nanoc 3.1.x, code snippets will no longer be managed by the data source, but will be loaded directly from <code>lib/</code> by the <code>Nanoc3::Site</code> class. It is therefore probably easier to manually create code snippets:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
File.open('lib/default.rb', 'w') do |io|
  io.write '# All files in the lib/ directory will automatically'
  io.write '# be loaded by nanoc when compiling the site.'
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Item Templates</h2>

I looked at the old nanoc2 source, and thought of a better way to handle templates. Two main things I didn't like about the old method were:

 * There was no way to generate the item attributes dynamically.
 * It used yet another data type in addition to pages, assets, layouts, and code snippets.

So, the idea I came up with was having the templates in code snippets. This solves both of the problems, and it lets you define multiple templates in each code snippet. A <code>define_template</code> method would be available in the code snippet namespace, and would work like this:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
define_template :template_name do |path|
  return [ { :meta => :attributes }, content ]
end
</code></pre>

When <code>nanoc3 create_item --template=template_name /item/path/</code> was run, the block would be called with the item's path as its first argument. It wouldn't be allowed to change the item's path, though. In addition, if any extra arguments were passed (like <code>nanoc3 ci -t template_name /item/path/ foo bar baz</code>), they would also be passed to the block (in this case, the block's arguments would be <code>[ '/item/path/', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' ]</code>). The block should return an array, the first item of which is the item's metadata and the second item is the actual content. nanoc3 will then go ahead and create the item. On the other hand, if a <code>Nanoc3::TemplateError</code> is raised (as in, <code>raise Nanoc3::TemplateError.new("Must specify an argument for the title")</code>), its message will be displayed to the user and the item will not be created.

A blog site could use this template:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
define_template :article do |path, title|
  raise Nanoc3::TemplateError.new("Please specify a post title after the item path") if title.nil?
  return [ {
    :kind => 'article',
    :created_at => DateTime.now,
    :title => title
  }, "A new post." ]
end
</code></pre>

It is somewhat easy to do this with Rake, although not terribly so. Passing commandline arguments (such as the page title) is possible using environment variables. Something like …

<pre><code>
rake create_item title="Hello World" path="/blog/2010/hello-world/"
</code></pre>

… is possible using a rake task like this:

<pre><code>
#!ruby
task :create_item do
  site = Nanoc3::Site.new('.')
  site.load_data

  site.data_sources[0].create_item(
    "default content goes here",
    { :title => ENV['title'] },
    ENV['path']
  )
end
</code></pre>

This can be improved a bit: for example, templates could then be defined using a <code>define_template</code> method that generates tasks like the one above.

Something like <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/12/by-thors-hammer/">Thor</a> may also be quite useful here, or perhaps even nanoc3’s built-in command line interface (with commands that inherit from <code>Cri::Command</code>. In fact, I believe that nanoc shouldn’t necessarily need to provide support for templates, but it should provide an API and a CLI that allow such features to be added.
