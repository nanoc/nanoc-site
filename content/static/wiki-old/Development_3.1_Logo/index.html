<h1>nanoc 3.1 Logo</h1>

Yep, nanoc needs a logo. This page gathers a few concepts.

<h2>Cheba 1</h2>

<i>Denis’</i> comments:

 * <b>Good</b>
   * I love the “n” in the logo, and I love the way it looks like a page. Subtle, but very effective.
 * <b>Bad</b>
   * I’m not fond of the typeface. It is too techy; I’d prefer a less futuristic font.

''cga's'' comments:
 * <b>Good</b>
   * I think this logo is perfect. It's harmonious, it's got style and it's well formed for buttons or Powered by logos. I like the font.

<h2>Cheba 2</h2>

<i>Denis’</i> comments:

 * <b>Good</b>
   * I like the way the logo actually takes elements from the site (the “missing edge”).
 * <b>Bad</b>
   * Again, the font doesn’t inspire me much. Too techy and futuristic.
   * This logo is probably also confusing because it looks like a document icon instead of a logo.

''cga's<i> comments:
 * <b>Bad</b>
   * This logo resembles a phone card, too square.

<h2>Cheba 3</h2>

</i>Denis’<i> comments: Meh… not a fan of this logo at all. The serif fonts are too classic and makes the logo look dated. The globe icon makes nanoc look like an airline company.

</i>cga's<i> comments:
 * <b>Bad</b>
   * This logo just plain suck XD


<h2>ddfreyne 1</h2>

These are a few variations combining Cheba’s logo mockups 1 and 2.

</i>cga's'' comments:
 * <b>Good</b>
   * Nice work on round variations.
 * <b>Bad</b>
   * I don't like the "missing edge" and the square apposition of some logos. I reckon it brakes/conflicts with the round shaped n and lines of the rest of the logo. Not to mention the toothpaste one :P

<h2>cga 1</h2>

[[Image(nanoc-logo-cga-grid.png)]]

These are my try for nanoc logo based on ddfreyne's 1 variations. Different and more classic font (verdana) regular and bold, underlined or not, black and white. with or without a frame and so on. i used a gray backgrond for the grid in order to make the frames clear.

<h2>cga Powered by try</h2>

A couple of try with Powered by. Changed the frame. Now a bit smoother and linear.

<h2>Nicholas O. Splendorr</h2>

As Nicholas said:

  I don't really think it's good enough yet, and may rely too heavily on the 3 -- which for some reason is my favorite part to type when I'm in the Terminal creating a new item or something. I kind of think some more-individualized shape might be good... but I don't know what, yet.
