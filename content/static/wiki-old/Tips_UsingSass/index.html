<h1>Using Sass</h1>

If you like using <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> for writing CSS, you can. nanoc comes with a Sass filter by default.

Step 1: Create an item that'll hold your Sass stylesheet. Put your Sass code in the item's content file.

Step 2: Create a rule (or modify an existing rule) so that the Sass stylesheet is filtered properly. For example:

<pre><code>
compile '/assets/style/*/' do
  filter :sass
end

route '/assets/style/*/' do
  item.identifier.chop + '.css' # so that the /assets/style/screen/ item is compiled to /assets/style/screen.css
end
</code></pre>

Step 3: There is no step 3.</pre>
